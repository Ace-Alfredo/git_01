## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
And cannot pleasures, while they last,  
Be actual unless, when past,  
They leave us shuddering and aghast,  
With anguish smarting?  
And cannot friends be firm and fast,     
    
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;   
    
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  
  
The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there   
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."      
    
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In twilight's soft embrace, the day does fade,  
A canvas painted with hues, a serenade.  
The moonlit whispers dance on silver streams,   
A lullaby weaving through the poet's dreams.   
  
Beneath the canopy of stars, a tale unfolds,  
Where secrets are shared and mysteries hold.  
The night, a velvet cloak, wraps the world tight,  
As shadows waltz in the gentle moonlight.  
  
A symphony of crickets, a chorus of the night,  
Echoes through the darkness, a soothing delight.  
The breeze, a gentle poet, sighs in rhyme,  
Caressing each leaf in the hushed pantomime.  
  
Celestial jewels adorn the sky's vast dome,  
A celestial ballet in the cosmic loam.  
The constellations tell stories untold,  
In the midnight tapestry, secrets unfold.  
  
Silent realms where dreams and fantasies meet,  
The universe whispers, enchantingly sweet.  
On this celestial stage, life's drama unfurls,  
A sonnet of existence, a dance of pearls.  
  
A tranquil hush blankets the world's embrace,   
In the stillness, find solace and grace.    
A nocturnal sonnet, a celestial plea,    
For the night to linger, in sweet mystery.
